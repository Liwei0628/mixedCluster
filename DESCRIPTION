Title: DBI-WC Clustering Algorithm for mixed-type distribution data
Version: 0.1.0

Description: In this R package, we implement two clustering algorithms, namely DBI-WC and SA-WC, tailored for mixed-type distribution data. DBI-WC employs a modified Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) to construct a DBI-weighted Wasserstein distance metric, extending the traditional Wasserstein distance. Combined with a robust initialization strategy, DBI-WC achieves strong performance on mixed-type distribution data. SA-WC algorithm is a simplified version of DBI-WC. SA-WC uses a straightforward weighting scheme to integrate various distribution data. All other specifications are consistent with those of DBI-WC.
